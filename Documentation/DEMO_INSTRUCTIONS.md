# Demo Instructions

## Quick Demo Setup

### Prerequisites
- macOS with Xcode 14+
- Python 3.8+
- Terminal access
- Internet connection

### 1. Environment Setup (2 minutes)

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd ConversationalAgent_CurrentSubmission

# Setup Python environment
chmod +x setup_environment.sh
./setup_environment.sh

# Activate environment
source rag_env/bin/activate
2. Start RAG Server (1 minute)
# Start the API server
./Scripts/run_api_server.sh
Expected Output:

Starting RAG API Server...
RAG System initialized successfully
Starting server on http://localhost:5000
* Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
* Running on http://[::1]:5000
3. Test System (2 minutes)
Open new terminal:

# Activate environment
source rag_env/bin/activate

# Run system tests
python Scripts/test_rag_system.py

# Run API demo
python Scripts/demo_script.py
4. iOS App Demo (3 minutes)
Open Xcode:

open iOS_App/ConversationalAgent.xcodeproj
Build and Run:

Select iPhone simulator
Press Cmd+R to build and run
Wait for app to launch
Test Chat Interface:

Type: "What is Swift programming language?"
Send message
Observe RAG-enhanced response with sources
Demo Script
Introduction (30 seconds)
"I've built a sophisticated conversational AI agent using SwiftUI that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation for enhanced responses. Let me show you the key features."

System Architecture (1 minute)
"The system consists of three main components:

SwiftUI iOS App - Native mobile interface
RAG API Server - Python Flask backend
Knowledge Retrieval System - Vector database + web search"
Live Demo Features
1. RAG System Test (2 minutes)
python Scripts/test_rag_system.py
Show:

Document retrieval speed
Relevance scoring
Multiple knowledge sources
Context-aware responses
2. API Endpoints (1 minute)
# Health check
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health

# Test query
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/retrieve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What is SwiftUI?", "top_k": 3}'
Highlight:

RESTful API design
JSON response format
Source attribution
3. iOS App Demo (3 minutes)
Feature Showcase:

Modern UI: SwiftUI declarative interface
Real-time Chat: Smooth animations and responses
Source Citations: Expandable source references
Context Memory: Multi-turn conversation awareness
Local Persistence: Conversation history storage
Demo Queries:

"What is Swift programming language?"
"How does SwiftUI work?"
"Explain RAG in AI"
"Tell me about iOS app development"
4. Technical Deep Dive (2 minutes)
Show Code:

AIService.swift - RAG integration
complete_rag_system.py - Vector search
ChatViewModel.swift - MVVM architecture
Highlight:

Production-ready code quality
Error handling and fallbacks
Async/await patterns
Memory management
Advanced Features
5. Web Knowledge Retrieval (1 minute)
# In Python terminal
from RAG_System.complete_rag_system import ProductionRAGSystem
rag = ProductionRAGSystem()
docs = rag.retrieve_context("latest iOS features", top_k=3)
print([doc.source for doc in docs])
Show:

Real-time web search
Wikipedia integration
Source diversity
6. Conversation Memory (1 minute)
# Test contextual understanding
rag.add_conversation_exchange(
    "What is Swift?", 
    "Swift is Apple's programming language"
)
docs = rag.retrieve_context("How do I use it for mobile apps?")
Demonstrate:

Context-aware retrieval
